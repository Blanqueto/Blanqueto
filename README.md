I really like cats and chocolate

# Operative Systems I use

<h2 align="center">GNU/Linux</h2>

   I really like GNU / Linux, not only for the freedom as a user they give you, but I also like to create and modify desktop environments a lot, one of my favorites is KDE PLASMA which I do not separate due to its incredible customization and Easy to use. My current and favorite distribution is ARTIX LINUX which I do not plan to change in a long time or maybe if as long as my PC can support KISS Linux or Gentoo, but at the moment I do not plan to do it for the little power that mine has. , when I have a better processor I will do it

## Some GNU/Linux distributions that I have used over time have been:

#### Debian Based:

Debian, MX Linux, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Deepin, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Hanna Montana Linux, Elementary OS, Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Annonymus OS. 

#### RedHat Based: 
Fedora, Opensuse.

#### Arch Linux Based:
Arch Linux, Artix, Manjaro, Arco Linux, KaOS.

#### Others: 
Slackware

These are some of the many distributions that I have used since I started two years ago so I still remember a bit how Fedora and Slackware are used. The others (Derived from Debian) if I remember them perfectly since my one of my relatives uses ubuntu and I am always there to support it


<h2 align="center">Windows 10</h2>

This is the operating system with which most start, I have actually achieved and learned quite a few things, I don't really use it much.
I only have it to update since I need it for school (although I do my work in Linux) so I don't depend so much and I have it in a small part of my disk so it is for drawing
